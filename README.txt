Other notes or comments to the grader:

jar name is SpotifyApp.jar.  Also, the program parses the csv files correctly from within eclipse, but not from running the jar itself, which is very odd.  Not sure why that is happening.

I have included some CSV Files to tests/read from.  All it does right now is show the meta-data attributes in a table.  That will be changed once I have time to implement more functionality. Also the graph view is under construction and i just stuck some random static data there in the meantime.
Additionally, I included a skip loading data button because that was in the rubric for A2.  I was not sure if this should or should not be there for the final product, because whats the point of opening the program if it shows no data... Thanks!
